### üß© Technologies Used:
- Express.js

## ‚õèÔ∏è What I Learned :

During the development of this project, I faced several challenges that helped me learn new skills and technologies. Some of the challenges I faced include building a Star component for leaving a rating for a meal, a Modal component, add slider, and make it responsive.

Through these challenges, I was able to gain a better understanding of React, CSS, and Frontend Development in general. I also learned how to work with Express.js, KnexJS, and PostgreSQL and mySQL to build a full-stack web application.

In addition to these technical skills, I also learned how to manage my time effectively and prioritize tasks to meet deadlines.


## üèÅ Getting Started <a name = "getting_started"></a>


### Environment variables

All sensitive data like fx passwords and usernames, we dont want to add to git! This problem we solve by having environment variables. Environment variables are not committed to git and have a key value structure.

Remember to copy the `.env.example` file, and rename the copied file to `.env`. In the `.env` file add the relevant host, database name, database user and pasword to your own local database.
